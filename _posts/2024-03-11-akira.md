# Introduction

In recent weeks, it has been difficult to overlook the subject that has captured widespread attention both in public discourse and the media — the security breach experienced by Tietoevry.

Akira, an offshoot derived from the Conti project, exhibited its malicious activities throughout 2023. This incident, in turn, had significant repercussions, impacting 120 government agencies.

# Scope
This will purely be a IDA statical analysis of a April sample, pre chacha20 vulnerability fix; which shouldn’t affect the overall structure. It will be based on the techniques listed below (leaving out link function at runtime and pe parsing). It also won’t show the steps the ransomware takes from execution to exit().

## ATT&CK MITRE Techniques

### Execution
- **Shared Modules (T1129)**: 
  - Parse PE header
  - Link function at runtime
- **Windows Management Instrumentation (T1047)**: 
  - Connect to WMI namespace via WbemLocator

### Defense Evasion
- **Obfuscated Files or Information: Indicator Removal from Tools (T1027.005)**: 
  - Contain obfuscated stackstrings (tightstrings)
- **Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027)**: 
  - Encode data using Base64
  - Create new key via CryptAcquireContext
  - Encrypt or decrypt via WinCrypt

### Discovery
- **System Information Discovery (T1082)**: 
  - Get system information on Windows
  - Get disk information
- **Process Discovery (T1057)**: 
  - Enumerate processes on remote desktop session host

### Imports
There’s no dynamic hash import that tries to obfuscate the actions of the malware. So all the calls and imports are available.

| Import      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ADVAPI32    | CrypEncrypt, CryptAquireContextW, CryptGenRandom|
| CRYPT32     | CryptDecodeObjectEX, CryptStringToBinaryA, CryptImportPublicKeyInfo|
| KERNEL32    | Windows OS API|
| OLEAUT32    | Object Linking|
| RstrtMgr    | Restart Manager|
| WS2_32      | WS_32_116, WS2_32_115|
| WTSAPI32    | WTSEnumerateProcessesW, WTSFreeMemory|
| ole32       | CoInitializeEx, CoUnitialize, CoCreateInstance, CoSetProxyBlanket

# Strings
## Ransomware Note
There’s a few interesting strings worth looking at. One being the ransomware note which is added to “akira_readme.txt” file.

## Encryption Key

Our hardcoded base64 Public key used with AES and RSA encryption. This is also, probably, the detection ATT&CK does for “encode data using Base64".

```c
db '-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----',0Ah
db 'MIICIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAg8AMIICCgKCAgEAylJbjtFvzHapC/sYdYK6',0Ah

db '-----END PUBLIC KEY-----',0Ah,0
```

The block where it’s used. Buffer pbBinary was set earlier.

![Encryption Block](/assets/images/akira/encryption_block.webp)

## Encryption Block

Our struct that takes the Base64 key and converts it into a array of bytes.

```c
BOOL CryptStringToBinaryA(
  [in]      LPCSTR pszString, (Public Key).
  [in]      DWORD  cchString, (Considered to be a null terminated if zero).
  [in]      DWORD  dwFlags, (CRYPT_STRING_BASE64HEADER).
  [in]      BYTE   *pbBinary, (Our buffer; was set earlier with memset()). 
  [in, out] DWORD  *pcbBinary, (Pointer to size of buffer).
  [out]     DWORD  *pdwSkip,
  [out]     DWORD  *pdwFlags
);
```

## Command Line Shadow Copy Delete
A common technique ransomware deploys are the deletion of shadow copy, to hinder tries to restore from backup data. However this string isn’t referenced in any function. But there’s a void function containing a tight string that executes this command line.

```c
db 'powershell.exe -Command "Get-WmiObject Win32_Shadowcopy | Remove-'
db 'WmiObject"',0
```

This void function is referenced in main();.

![f_PowerShell_Shadow_Copy_Remove()](/assets/images/akira/f_powershell_shadow_copy.webp)

## ATT&CK MITRE Techniques
### Execution

“Connect to WMI namespace via IWbemLocator” is “basically” the setup to use the shadow copy remove command which is used through WMI. The longer explanation is that Akira need the interface to user the namespace pointer to IWbemServices interfaces so it can access the windows management instrumentation through IWbemLocator::ConnectServer.

First being initializing COM through CoCreateInstance. What could be done to further analyse the struct and how it’s used, is by utilizing oleviewdotnet.

### Initializing COM
We could from decoding this get what class is being used, which would lead us to IWbemLocator, [MS-WMI]: IWbemClassObject Interface | Microsoft Learn.

### GUID struct
It uses the IWbemLocator interface to use ConnectServer() which is how it can use the WMI namespace.

Then we’re off querying (WbemServices::GetObject) the WMI for methods and classes to use; except for Create which is used with “CreateInstanceEnumAsync”.

SysAllocString(L"Create"); => Instance
SysAllocString(L"Win32_Process"); => Class
SysAllocString(L"Win32_ProcessStartup"); => Class

Loading in the parameter (shadow copy delete..) and setting to a binary string by using the VariantInit(&pvarg).

Second to last it uses IWbemServices::ExecMethod from with the methods that it set up above.

Lastly it performs the clean-up procedure.

### Defence Evasion
The first technique for the spotted defense evasion was tight strings, which are obfuscated stack strings. These strings are passed onto the stack, but without a decoding loop, they would appear as gibberish. Akira uses a simple obfuscation technique that performs arithmetic operations on the characters, represented by their numeric values.

Below is a small code snippet to demonstrate reversing the obfuscation. It is recommended to use a plugin or tools like FLOSS to emulate and decode all the stack/tight strings.

```python
v_cmd = [None] * 13

v_cmd[0] = 29
v_cmd[1] = 86
v_cmd[2] = 4
v_cmd[3] = 86
v_cmd[4] = 90
v_cmd[5] = 86
v_cmd[6] = 98
v_cmd[7] = 86
v_cmd[8] = 24
v_cmd[9] = 86
v_cmd[10] = 40
v_cmd[11] = 86
v_cmd[12] = 24


for i in range(len(v_cmd)):
    v_cmd[i] = (25 * (v_cmd[i] - 86) % 127 + 127) % 127

for j in range(len(v_cmd)):
    if v_cmd[j] != 0:
        print(chr(v_cmd[j]), end="")
```

        
Second defence evasion technique it uses is creating new key via CryptAcquireContextW. Which isn’t really used in ransomware as a defence mechanism… CryptAcquireContextW is used to acquire a handle to a key container. From the image below we can gather that our CSP is “Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider”, four parameter 0x18 the CSP type is AES and RSA. The handled is returned through phProv.


### CryptAcquireContext
BOOL CryptAcquireContextW(
  [out] HCRYPTPROV *phProv,      (Pointer to a handle of a CSP.)
  [in]  LPCWSTR    szContainer,  (Key container name.)
  [in]  LPCWSTR    szProvider,   (String with the CSP name used.)
  [in]  DWORD      dwProvType,   (Specifies provider to aquire.)
  [in]  DWORD      dwFlags       
);

Third one is encryption or decryption via WinCrypt. WinCrypt.h is simply a header file that contains our API calls to our crypto functions. APIs used through WinCrypt.h are:

- **CryptEncrypt**: Encrypts data.
- **CryptAcquireContextW**: Gets handle for key container within a CSP.
- **CryptGenRandom**: Generates a random number.
- **CryptDecodeObjectEx**: Decodes structures.
- **CryptStringToBinaryA**: Converts a formatted string into an array of bytes.
- **CryptImportPublicKeyInfo**: Imports and converts public key information.

### Discovery
“Get system information on Windows” seems abit obscure in what it’s trying to convey. However, Akira is using GetSystemInfo which returns the SYSTEM_INFO struct. From there reaching for the dwNumberOf Processors.


It seems to check if it returns 0, if so, then jumps towards the end of main() and quits. Doesn’t seem to use this information regarding the processesor or the SYSTEM_INFO struct any further.

```c
typedef struct _SYSTEM_INFO {
  union {
    DWORD dwOemId;
    struct {
      WORD wProcessorArchitecture;
      WORD wReserved;
    } DUMMYSTRUCTNAME;
  } DUMMYUNIONNAME;
  DWORD     dwPageSize;
  LPVOID    lpMinimumApplicationAddress;
  LPVOID    lpMaximumApplicationAddress;
  DWORD_PTR dwActiveProcessorMask;
  DWORD     dwNumberOfProcessors;   // The number of logical processors in the current group.    
  DWORD     dwProcessorType;
  DWORD     dwAllocationGranularity;
  WORD      wProcessorLevel;
  WORD      wProcessorRevision;
} SYSTEM_INFO, *LPSYSTEM_INFO;
```

### Drive Enumeration

Akira used `GetLogicalDriveStringsW` to enumerate and fill a buffer with available drives.

- **Buffer Initialization**: The buffer is initialized using `memset`.
- **Wide String Handling**: Since `GetLogicalDriveStringsW` is for wide strings, the string buffer is typecast as a wide string using `LPWSTR(v3)`.

### Process Enumeration

The technique “Enumerate processes on remote desktop session host” is somewhat misleading. Akira is not known to perform this action. Instead, it uses `WTSEnumerateProcessesW`, which, according to MSDN documentation, can enumerate processes on the host running the software (Akira).

### Off-Topic Observations

#### Exceptions Handling

Akira uses `__try` blocks to trigger specific actions when encountering certain names and folders. The `RUNTIME FUNCTIONS` in `.pdata` are part of the `CxxFrameHandler4`, which suggests that these names are ignored during enumeration.

- **.pdata Section**: Contains runtime function information.
- **.rdata Section**: Contains read-only data.

### Yara Rule

To conclude this analysis, a Yara Rule was written. While not production-ready, it is based on observations from this sample.
